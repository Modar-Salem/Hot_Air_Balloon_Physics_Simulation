# Hot_Air_Balloon_Physics_Simulation
This is a physics simulation of a hot air balloon created using the Three.js library. The simulation models the behavior of a hot air balloon as it rises and falls in the air based on various physical factors such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed

The simulation is designed to provide an interactive and visually engaging experience for users who are interested in learning more about the physics of hot air balloons. Users can adjust various parameters such as the temperature of the air inside the balloon, the weight of the payload, and the wind speed to see how these factors affect the balloon's flight.

The simulation also includes realistic 3D graphics and animations that accurately depict the movement of the balloon as it rises and falls in the air. Users can view the simulation from different angles and perspectives to get a better understanding of how hot air balloons work.

Overall, this physics simulation is a great educational tool for anyone interested in learning more about the science behind hot air balloons. It provides an immersive and interactive experience that makes learning about physics fun and engaging.
